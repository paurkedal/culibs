 * Definition (normalised file name).  A normalised file name is a string
 * subject to the following restrictions.  The maximum substrings not
 * containing "/" are called components.  Components of the form "",
 * "." and ".." are called special components.  A file name is
 * either absolute or relative.  An normalised absolute file name is
 * either "/", or starts with an empty component followed by one or
 * more non-special components.  A normalised relative file name is either
 * ".", or it starts with zero or more "..", followed by zero or more
 * non-special components, but adding up to at least one component.
