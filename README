Garbage Collected C Libraries

    For elaborate documentation, see http://www.eideticdew.org/culibs/.

    This source code contains several C libraries.  It is split into
    modules, where each module roughly corresponds to one libary:

	cu	Common infrastructure
	cucon	Containers and algorithms
	cugra	Graphs and graph algorithms
	cuex	Expression trees and related algorithms
	cudyn	Dynamically typed objects.  Coupled with cuex.
	cuos	OS interface (file system, sub-processes, etc.)


Compiling and Installing

    In addition to a POSIX system library with librt support, you need:
      * The Boehm-Demers-Weiser Conservative Garbage Collector
      * libatomic_ops
      * libffi (at least for now)
      * buddy  (at least for now)
    Optionally, the following may be used
      * libunwind (for debugging stack trace)

    In the simplest case,

	./configure [OPTIONS]
	make
	make install
	make install-doc  # Optional, installs same docs as on above URL

    See INSTALL for more info.


Copiling and Linking against the Modules

    These libraries use pkg-config.

    Using Autoconf, add

	PKG_CHECK_MODULES(CULIBS, modules)

    to your configure.ac, where modules is the desired set of modules to
    link against.  Then refer to $CULIBS_CFLAGS and $CULIBS_LIBS in your
    Makefile.in or Makefile.am.

    You can also build directly from the command line with

	gcc -c `pkg-config --cflags modules` ...	# compile
	gcc -o prg `pkg-config --libs modules` ...	# link
