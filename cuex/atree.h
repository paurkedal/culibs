/*!\defgroup cuex_atree_h cuex/atree.h: Associative Trees of Expressions
 *@{\ingroup cuex_mod
 *
 * This is a low-level interface for implementing semi-lattices, sets, maps,
 * and other collections of expressions which are keyed on a machine word
 * computed form the expressions.
 *
 * The internal structure of the tree is hidden.  The leafs of the tree are the
 * inserted expressions.
 * Most of the functions below takes a \a get_key argument, which when passed a
 * leaf node shall compute a \c cu_word_t typed key.
 * Since \c cu_word_t is at least the size of pointers, to implement a set of
 * hash-consed objects, cast the leaf value pointer to \c cu_word_t, and to
 * implement a map, use a binary operation as leafs, and cast the first operand
 * to \c cu_word_t.
 * The same \a get_key must be used consistently when operating on the same
 * tree, which also means that union and intersections can only be used on
 * trees of the same \a get_key.
 * A high-level interface will typically embed these trees in a top-level node
 * and either use a fixed \a get_key or one stored on the top-level node.  */

/*!\defgroup cuex_atree_iv_mod Indexed Value Variants
 * The following functions are specialised variants of the corresponding
 * functions from the \ref cuex_atree_h "primary interface", where the leafs are
 * assumed to be operations of sufficient arity, and callbacks acting on leaves
 * are replaced by callbacks action on a given operand of the leaves.  The
 * caller is responsible of ensuring that all leafs have the proper form.

 * and the second operand serves as a value.  Callbacks generally receive the
 * key as the first argument and one or two values as the next arguments.
